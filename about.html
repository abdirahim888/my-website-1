    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>EcoVibe is a movement dedicated to sustainability, education, and environmental action.</p>
    <p>It all started in 2025 when a group of eco-conscious individuals decided to unite and take action against the growing environmental challenges we face. The idea was simple yet powerful: to create a space where anyone, anywhere, could find accessible tools, resources, and inspiration to live more sustainably. Our journey has been one of growth, learning, and constant innovation. From humble beginnings to a growing movement, EcoVibe continues to spread the message of environmental awareness to people around the globe </p>
